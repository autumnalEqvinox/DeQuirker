To run, you must have python 3 installed along with the necessary libraries. To install a library, run the "pip install" command followed by the library name. If you are missing any the program will tell you

Please contact me if you run into any issues or bugs.

Currently, the program must be run in full to not run into any errors. If you stop the program during the first run you might need to delete the files created by the program. Downloading the HTML files will take a while but it should run much faster after it is done with that.
